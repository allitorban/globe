# Create a globe in R


First, I downloaded the data from the Natural Earth site. Under "Admin 0 - Countries" click on "Download countries", which will download a zipped shapefile of the countries in the world: https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/

Unzip the file and put the .shp file somewhere convenient.

Run the scripts in the text file in R.

Example result:
